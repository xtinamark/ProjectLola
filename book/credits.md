The introduction, structure of the book and formatting of contents is done by the Editors. Some chapters and pages have additional primary authors who are identified within the book either at the bottom of the first page in a chapter, or at the bottom of an individual page, as necessary. If an author is not listed on a particular page, it is by the Editors.

You can refer to individual chapters or pages within this book as:

> `<Primary Author>` (`<date>`) `<Title of Chapter or Page>`. In `<editors>` (Ed.), _`<title>`_. `<url to github repo>`

We anticipate that the content of this book will change significantly. Therefore, we recommend using the source code directly with the citation above that refers to the GitHub repository and lists the date and name of the file. Although content will be added over time, chapter titles and URL's in this book are expected to remain relatively static. However, we make no guarantee, so if it is important for you to reference a specific location within the book. For example:

> `<Primary Author>` (`<date>`) `<Title of Chapter or Page>`. In `<editors>` (Ed.),  _`<title>`_. `<url to github repo>` (`./book/intro/` chapter, accessed November, 2024).

## How the book is made
